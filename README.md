# Tangled Treasures

Welcome to Tangled Treasures!
This is my attmpt to submit a project, the final project, in just 5 days.
It is not finished, and it is not perfect, but I gave it all my energies and free time of the last 5 days. 
Due to personal circumstances, I wasn't able to commit as much time as I wanted to those last couple of projects, but I have enjoyed every minute, and I am sure I will keep studyng and practicing. Thank you for the opportunity, and for time.
